MemeticRoutes
=============

memetic_routes is a lightweight version of the metaprogramming function from historic_routes. It will automatically persist a parameter into a named route.


Example
=======

There are two tabs which switch between data visualizations:

Table View: </results/_table_view.html.erb> and Heatmap View: </results/_heat_map.html.erb>

These partials are rendered from a single page:

</results.html.erb>

which has a shared sidebar that posts to a named route using:

<% form_tag search_url do %>

The /results route looks like this:

map.search_url '/results/:visualization', :visualization => /table_view|heat_map/, :defaults => {:visualization => 'table_view'}, :remember => :visualization

:remember states that when search_url is called, params[:visualization] is automatically merged into the url options hash.

On the heatmap view search_url will result in:

/results/heat_map

and on the table_view the search_url will result in:

/results/table_view

You can keep using this url to persist the value, without having to save it away in the users' sessions.
